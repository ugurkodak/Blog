	<p>This is my small space on the internet where I talk about anything that I find interesting. If it's a game project or anything related to programming, I almost always have a link to the source code at my GITHUB page. When I have an update about something, it jumps to the top contained within it's related post and history. If you want to contact me, send an EMAIL and if you want to learn about my background visit my LINKEDIN page.</p>
	<p>Cheers.</p>
